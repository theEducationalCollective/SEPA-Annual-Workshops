# SEPA-Annual-Workshops
Annual Statistics and Computing Workshops for SEPA (Southeastern Psychological Association) Meetings. These workshops have been presented by:

+ Maria Misiura, MA
+ Jessica A. Turner, PhD
+ Matthew D. Turner, PhD

and the workshops in general are orgainzed by Matthew Turner (mturner46 .at. gsu dot edu).

Workshop titles are kept constant, and they are orgainzed by year then title. Later year workshops with the same title are basically the same as previous years, but are likely improved with any errors found corrected and updated to more recent versions of R. So if you are looking for a topic, it is likely best to use the most recent year, even if that is not the workshop you attended.

This website was re-arranged in a big way in 2019, so older links are now broken, but we will attempt to keep things organized consistently from here on out.

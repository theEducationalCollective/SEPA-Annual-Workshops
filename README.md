# SEPA-Annual-Workshops
Annual Statistics and Computing Workshops for SEPA (Southeastern Psychological Association) Meetings. These workshops have been presented by a variety of people (see individual workshop files for credits). The main contributor is Matthew Turner, who also maintains the collection as a whole and who should be contacted for more information, to file bug reports, etc. (mturner46 AT gsu DOT edu).

All of the original workshops are collected and stored as originally presented, but they may be modified to fix any errors that we become aware of as time passes. These workshops are also intended for self-study, so if you use them and discover problems, please contact me at the email above.

This website was re-arranged in a big way in 2019, so older links pointing to it are now broken, but we will attempt to keep things organized consistently from here on out.

Zip files of the most recent versions of the individual workshops presented at SEPA are available at [osf.io](https://osf.io/hnq32/). These may be cited as: _Turner, M. D. (2019, March 27). R Tutorials, Self-Study Materials, and Workshops. Retrieved from osf.io/hnq32._

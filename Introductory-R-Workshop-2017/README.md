# SEPA2017-R-Workshop
SEPA 2017 R Workshop: R from Startup to Statistics.

This repository contains the original materials for the R workshop at SEPA 2017. It may be downloaded in its entirety by clicking the green "clone or download" button at the upper right part of the page. From there, select "download zip" to download all the files as a single zip archive. 

You may also look at the individual files in the archive, however Github cannot render all of them in a useful format (such as Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, etc.).

All the relevant files will be provided at the workshop for copying from USB sticks. This archive is provided for people who either need to obtain the files outside of the workshop, or who need duplicate copies. Please note that the files will be organized differently between here and the USBs from the workshop.
